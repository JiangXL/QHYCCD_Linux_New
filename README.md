# QHYCCD_Linux_New
This QHYCCD SDK repository contains targz files supporting Ubuntu Linux 64 bit and ARM V8 processors. The Linux version was tested on Intel Core I7 processor. The ARM version was tested on Raspberry PI3 and Odroid XU4 embedded machines, but should possibly run on other ARM V8 embedded systems. 

Please untar requested targz file in your directory with: tar xzvf file_name.tar.gz file, go to the install_scripts and run: sudo ./linux_install_qhyccd_sdk_driver.sh script. This will install all the necessary files on your Linux machine. Please see also documentation inside the doc directory.
